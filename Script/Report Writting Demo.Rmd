# Abstract

# Introduction

Yam production in Nigeria is one of the largest agricultural produce [@pérez-flores2017a]. Knowing the nutrient composition of litter is useful for planning nutrient management of plantations [@bai2022leaf]. In Cocoa (\*Theobroma\* \*cacao\* L.) plantations, tree species are combined in different vertical strata [@fontes2014nutrient; @pérez-flores2017a]. Cocoa litter has a poor quality @fontes2014nutrient reported N rate in cocoa litter was low .

# Hello

This report contains the work flow in which I used in performing my analysis. It also contains `r ncol(iris)`.

```{r t_test}
t.test(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width)
```

```{r library, load}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r Visualization}
ggplot(data = iris,aes(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,col=Species))+
  geom_point()
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r table}
library(dplyr)
iris %>% knitr::kable()
```
